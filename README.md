# Blanko Quaternions

This is a my personal libary for complex numbers, dual numbers, quaternions and dual quaternions.
It started out as a library for quaternions only but then I wanted to have similar number types as well, so here we are.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Mathematical methods for all types (exp,log,powi,powf,lerp,slerp,sclerp)
- [ ] Find a good way to operate between types (especially multiplication between types)
- [ ] Ease of use (need feedback for that)
- [ ] Better documentation
